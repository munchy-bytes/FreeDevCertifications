# FREE Professional Certification Exams

Professional certification recognizes your knowledge and experience and enhances your professional credibility. Many students and developers cannot get certified since they cannot pay the certifications exams fees. After a little research on the internet, I found several certification exams available for free by leading tech providers and I liked to share them. I will be grateful for any contribution. And I hope that this will help someone to get a better opportunity.
